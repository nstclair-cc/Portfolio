    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This exploratory study aimed to understand how experienced data practitioners navigate and interpret unfamiliar multidimensional datasets. Our research team conducted a series of semi-structured think-aloud interviews with ten data experts across diverse sectors to explore how they reason about structure, hierarchy, and usability in complex datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      I served as first author and researcher with two senior scientists, managing the interview process, analyzing transcripts, and presenting our findings at the 2023 International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) conference, where our paper received an outstanding paper award.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do data experts from various fields approach unfamiliar multidimensional datasets?</li>
        <li>What interaction patterns emerge when they create, manipulate, and structure data tables?</li>
        <li>What patterns emerge in how they create, manipulate, and structure data tables, and how can these insights inform design improvements for students learning to analyze data in digital tools like CODAP?</li>
      </ul> 
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>The Solution</h4>
    <p>
      Through ten think-aloud interviews, we identified key patterns in expert approaches to structuring multidimensional data. While we expected more hierarchical visualizations, most experts began with flat tables and adapted as needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some used subsets or extracted elements to create hierarchy</li>
      <li>Others built out relational databases from large or unwieldy tables</li>
      <li>A few worked entirely within flat formats while mentally modeling complexity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These findings reshaped how our team thought about student-facing data layouts and directly informed a subsequent student study within a $3M NSF-funded research initiative.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Aligning Goals</h4>
    <p>
      This project was a key turning point in my research practice. I learned to facilitate and analyze expert interviews, surface rich qualitative insights, and work cross-functionally with senior researchers to translate those insights into product and research decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project also demonstrated how careful attention to expert workflows could shape student-centered design and evaluation. This work laid the foundation for more iterative, research-informed design practices within our data education tools.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Discover</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviewed 10 data experts from academic, nonprofit, and industry backgrounds</li>
      <li>Developed and iterated on an interview protocol rooted in qualitative design research</li>
      <li>Used transcription tools and open coding to analyze expert reasoning about table structures, hierarchy, and relational modeling</li>
      <li>Segmented data by sector, organization size, and tool usage (e.g., R, Excel, CODAP, relational DBs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Define</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Experts overwhelmingly began by scanning flat tables and mentally organizing subsets before formalizing hierarchy</li>
      <li>Analysts adapted their strategies based on tool familiarity, data complexity, and domain expectations</li>
      <li>Early quotes pulled from these interviews shaped our later work with students and influenced how we introduced hierarchy and structure in CODAPâ€™s design</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Develop</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Led data segmentation and synthesis for team use across roles and product decisions</li>
      <li>Extracted key quotes and narratives that guided later student protocol design</li>
      <li>Worked closely with two senior researchers to frame findings and co-author our ISLS submission</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Deliver</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>First author on an award-winning paper presented at ISLS 2023</li>
      <li>Findings directly shaped a later student interview study focused on how learners structure and analyze data</li>
      <li>Established a new research precedent for incorporating expert workflows into early design and evaluation cycles</li>
      <li>Helped inform UX and layout recommendations for multidimensional table structures in the CODAP platform</li>
    </ul>
