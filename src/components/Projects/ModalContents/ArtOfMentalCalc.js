    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
      As an undergraduate double majoring in art and mathematics, I collaborated with Dr. Arthur Benjamin to illustrate and co-author a 40-lesson mental math curriculum for middle school students. Our goal was to make mental arithmetic engaging, visual, and accessible — a project that bridged my passions for math education and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      This early project grew into an ongoing partnership: I later illustrated and typeset Dr. Benjamin’s New York Times bestselling books, <em>The Magic of Math</em> and <em>Secrets of Mental Math</em>, helping to bring clarity and visual delight to hundreds of mathematical concepts.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Problem Statement</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>How can we help middle school students master Dr. Benjamin's mental math techniques through clear visuals and an intuitive layout?</li>
      <li>What design strategies can make abstract arithmetic patterns feel playful, accessible, and fun?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>The Solution</h4>
    <p>
      I developed hundreds of custom mathematical illustrations that demonstrated patterns in mental addition, subtraction, and number sense. These visuals served as step-by-step scaffolds for learners and complemented Dr. Benjamin’s signature teaching style.
    </p>
    <p>
      We built the book collaboratively across multiple time zones, using Adobe Illustrator for figures and LaTeX for precise mathematical typesetting. The end result was a fully illustrated 120-page curriculum that continues to be used and shared through Dr. Benjamin’s best-selling books.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Aligning Goals</h4>
    <p>
      This was a passion project and a turning point for me. I learned how to collaborate on large-scale creative and educational works, navigate the intricacies of remote production, and blend my love of math with visual storytelling. I also got very good at spotting typos — and occasionally, introducing them.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Discover</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed illustrations to support number sense, mental arithmetic tricks, and math storytelling</li>
      <li>Collaborated remotely with Dr. Benjamin to iterate on pedagogical design and layout</li>
      <li>Used LaTeX to typeset answer keys, exercises, and visual layouts with mathematical precision</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Define</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Identified which concepts most needed visual scaffolds for student understanding</li>
      <li>Developed a consistent visual style across multiple books and teaching materials</li>
      <li>Balanced clarity, creativity, and educational integrity across hundreds of math diagrams</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Develop</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Illustrated and typeset the full original curriculum, plus two 120-page follow-up books</li>
      <li>Produced hundreds of diagrams covering everything from simple shortcuts to algebraic patterns</li>
      <li>Iterated closely with the author to match tone, clarity, and teaching intent</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Deliver</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><em>The Art of Mental Calculation</em> was published and promoted through Arthur Benjamin’s platforms</li>
      <li>Went on to illustrate <em>The Magic of Math</em> and <em>Secrets of Mental Math</em>, both New York Times bestsellers</li>
      <li>Created a reusable visual design system for educational math content</li>
      <li>Discovered one of my superpowers: making mathematical ideas come alive through design</li>
    </ul>
