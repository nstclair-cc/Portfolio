    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This project began with a simple challenge: create a TED-Ed lesson that illuminates the connection between math and art. Working closely with TED-Ed producers, we quickly realized there was more than one story worth telling. The project grew into a three-part animated series exploring math through the lenses of visual art, music, and performing arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote and co-developed all three scripts, collaborating with editors, producers, animators, and fact-checkers across multiple time zones. From Van Gogh’s swirling skies to Shakespearean authorship, each story uncovered surprising ways that mathematical thinking shapes the arts — and the way we understand the world.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Problem Statement</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>How can we use storytelling to spark curiosity about mathematics — especially in creative disciplines where it’s least expected?</li>
      <li>What’s the right balance of narrative, technical rigor, and visual clarity for a global student audience?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>The Solution</h4>
    <p>
      I crafted three stories at the intersection of mathematics and art:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-unexpected-math-behind-van-gogh-s-starry-night-natalya-st-clair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Unexpected Math Behind Van Gogh’s Starry Night</a> — visual art & turbulence</li>
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/M51Bm9sNazM?si=cv4vE00xiZL2-JmA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Math Behind Music</a> — sound waves & sinusoidal functions</li>
      <li><a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/did-shakespeare-write-his-plays-natalya-st-clair-and-aaron-williams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Did Shakespeare Write His Plays?</a> — authorship attribution & frequency analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These lessons combined research with creative pedagogy, each paired with animations to help global audiences see and feel the math embedded in the arts.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Aligning Goals</h4>
    <p>
      The initial goal was a single lesson — but after brainstorming with TED-Ed producers, we expanded the scope to three domains of artistic expression. It was a collaborative, cross-disciplinary effort with editorial, animation, and production teams all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the biggest wins was learning to adapt creative mathematical ideas for an international student audience — and doing it in a way that was clear, joyful, and visually rich.
    </p>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Discover</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Researched math applications across disciplines: literature, music theory, and visual analysis</li>
      <li>Crafted scripts that translated abstract math into engaging narratives with visual storytelling potential</li>
      <li>Collaborated with TED-Ed’s team of editors, animators, and producers to ensure clarity and accuracy</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Define</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Iterated heavily on the Shakespeare video — it took multiple rounds to land on the right story structure</li>
      <li>Balanced mathematical accuracy with wide accessibility, especially for global audiences aged 13–18</li>
      <li>Developed visuals using Illustrator to help the animation teams bring complex math ideas to life</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Develop</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Wrote and revised 3 full-length TED-Ed scripts</li>
      <li>Created original math diagrams and sketches used as visual references for animation teams</li>
      <li>Worked across production teams in multiple time zones, navigating asynchronous workflows and editorial cycles</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style={headingStyles.h4}>Deliver</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>9M+ views</strong> on the Van Gogh video alone</li>
      <li>Named <strong>“Best TED-Ed Lesson of All Time”</strong> in 2018</li>
      <li>Project inspired further interdisciplinary math-art curriculum work</li>
      <li>Learned the joy (and challenge) of writing educational content for global learners</li>
      <li>Grateful to collaborate with TED-Ed visionaries like Logan Smalley and Alex Gendler</li>
    </ul>
