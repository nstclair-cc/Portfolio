    <h4>Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Leading front-end design, branding & identity for the Growth & Marketing teams at Hiretual to bring awareness of our AI-Powered SaaS platform to recruiters and sourcers worldwide.<br />
      <br />
      Hiretual's recruitment software transforms the hiring technology of today to build a workforce for the future using intelligent sourcing, engagement, analysis, and integrations with over 45+ existing platforms.<br />
      <br />
      I was brought on as the second designer for the marketing team shortly after Hiretual raised funding for a Series B round, learning to work cross-functionally with many different teams to get a multitude of deliverables out, ranging from responsive landing pages to downloadable eBooks.
    </p>
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>
      How can we create a professional brand image that not only propels Hiretual's product across the sourcing and recruiting industry, but throughout the world as well while surpassing the company's monthly revenue goals as well?
    </p>
    <h4>The Solution</h4>
    <p>
      Developing a cleaner style for the company's branding with another designer, emphasizing ease of use and functionality over aesthetics while not sacrificing on quality of designs. Helped to completely rebrand the main website, achieving more than $1M of revenue over the set goal every month since the launch back in June 2021.
    </p>
    <h4>Aligning Goals</h4>
    <p>
      Although I was only the second designer on the marketing team, there was no clear image or strong brand for Hiretual when I joined. Looking over the old designs, there needed to be a revamp in both image and messaging; at first, users were confused because we used fancy terminology to stand out from the handful of other talent sourcing platforms within our market. Instead of going for a more randomized design, I started to implement a design system for the marketing team to use because we had to push out nearly 500 landing pages for our biggest campaign at the time. Designing every single page by hand is tedious and inefficient, so a design system made it simpler to push out deliverables on time in order to meet revenue goals.
    </p>
    <h4>Discover</h4>
    <p>
      As a designer, I worked with a wide variety of very talented people on my team. Working with a lot of digital content strategists, content writers, community, paid ad, brand, and SEO specialists opened my eyes to how marketing worked in the startup world, and more importantly about how proper leadership from my managers can help support the whole entire team to achieve a lot of revenue. Learning how MQLs worked, how organic traffic is preferred over paid ad traffic, and other skills helped me develop a clean, consistent look for the brand across teams.
      <br />
      From there, I would research more into how marketing was executed from a startup perspective and how we would use different platforms like Sense6, Google Ads, and Pardot to drive our marketing efforts. I learned about the other competitors within the space, learning how the team works, and how we can grow our own company through marketing efforts.
