    quote: "Talya’s ability to identify the full extent of a problem, think it through, and execute on the related needs independently is exceptional. On multiple occasions I’ve seen her identify an issue, produce an assessment of it, and provide a full-featured proposal for addressing it in a way that often surprised myself or others.
